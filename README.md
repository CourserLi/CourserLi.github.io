# Welcome to __CourserLi's__ Blog

I think **Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs

**So ,I choose Jekyll to set up blogs~**

- I will update my blogs once around one or two months   
- I will develop and publish new features from now on

# Conversation

- maybe I will public forum platform no soon
- and so please also pay more attention to me
